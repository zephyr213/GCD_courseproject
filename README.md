## Description 
The script run_analysis.R needs the data folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in the same directory, which contains the data needed. Or the path to the folder can be edited in the script.

This script creates a merged data set with the test and train data set, but only includes the mean and std data.

Below is the purpose of the script:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.erges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

## Contents:
CodeBook.md includes the description of the variables.
run_analysis.R is the analysis script.
UCI HAR Dataset folder has the input data needed for the script above.
